# coding-events
work done in java chapters 13 through 19

Purpose of App:  To list events and information about them.

It is a fun lesson for me to learn Spring Boot and Hibernate
plus how to have one to one, one to many, and many to many relationships.

Current state of the app
This finishes chapter 18

The next chapter will allow a person to interact with the list by adding or deleting events.

I would call this section a user section (same as most apps on a computer)
It would have fields for unsername, password, ID, first and last name, address, email,
events they attend, and events they create.
